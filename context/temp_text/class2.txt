How to use Data to Make Decisions
Analytical & Critical Thinking (finding meaning in data)
• Statistical literacy → averages vs. distributions, correlation vs.
causation.
• Business problem framing → translating vague questions into data
queries.
• Comparative analysis → trends, cohorts, benchmarks, time-series
analysis.
• Decision logic → recommending why and what to act on, not just
what happened.
• Scenario & sensitivity testing → “What if we change this variable?”

Breakdown of the MRI Project
1. MRI 2-bay Workflow Project:

• Simulate staff/patient actions through Siemens 2-bay MRI suite.
• Use sims to identify bottlenecks, staff overtasking and evaluate new patient
scheduling proposals.

2. MRI Staff Scheduling Optimization:

• Incorporate MRI technologist preferences into staff schedule generation for all
Halifax MR systems while maintaining operational hours.

3. MRI Protocol Duration Analytics:

• Use metadata from PACs MRI database to calculate protocol duration for 154 MRI
protocols deployed over MRIs across NS.
• Useful for tracking efficiency improvements and as future inputs to patient exam
schedulers.

4. MRI Patient Scheduling Optimization (in progress):

• Use protocol duration data and 2-bay workflow sims to create a patient schedule
with reduced scanner-idle time (no-shows, late-shows, patient withdraw).

MRI 2-Bay Workflow Project (#1)

3T MRI

• First 2-bay MRI suite in NS
• 4 safety zone workflow
• 6 staff operate facility (4
techs, 1 porter, 1 TA)
Can you take patient schedule
and staff workflow step map as
input and identify
bottlenecks/staff over-tasking?

• MRI Tech Student Project
identifying every step in
process.
• Each step involves a
primary staff, backup staff
if primary unavailable, a
space in floorplan, and an
execution time.
• Simulate scenarios with
varied probabilities
(contrast setup, contrast
reaction emergency,
implant safety lookup).

Do we have the correct step
template?

Patient Schedule Inputs (Template)
• Patient booking staff use these
templates to create patient
appointments.
• Each block represents an exam
with specified duration
(Inpatient time varies).
• Do simulations of different daily
schedules produce different
issues (bottlenecks, staff overtasking)?
• Can simulations be validated
with floor observational
measures?
• Can a better template be
devised to distribute workload
more efficiently?

Monthly Exam counts in CZ increased from ~1050 to ~1250 in July when DG opened.
DG performs ~450 exams/month offsetting ~250 lost exams in July from Trailer MRI closure.
Monthly Exam counts ~1700 in November as both Siemens magnets schedule stabilizing.

• Process refers to a series of
actions or steps taken to
achieve a specific goal or
produce a particular result.
• A well-defined process helps
ensure consistency, efficiency,
and quality in achieving the
desired outcome.

18

• Process management is the
discipline of overseeing and
improving processes to enhance
efficiency, productivity, and
quality. It involves identifying,
analyzing, designing, executing,
monitoring, and optimizing
processes within an organization
or system.

Process Flow Chart
• A flowchart is a picture of the separate
steps of a process in sequential order. It is a
generic tool that can be adapted for a wide
variety of purposes, and can be used to
describe various processes, such as a
manufacturing process, an administrative or
service process, or a project plan. It's a
common process analysis tool and one of
the seven basic quality tools.
• Elements that may be included in a
flowchart are a sequence of actions,
materials or services entering or leaving the
process (inputs and outputs), decisions that
must be made, people who become
involved, time involved at each step, and/or
process measurements.

• To provide an overview of process modeling
• To understand the basic components of the Arena
Environment

Objectives

• To be able to perform simple Monte Carlo simulations in
Arena
• To be able to recognize and define the characteristics of a
discrete-event dynamic system (DEDS)

• To be able to develop and read an activity flow diagram
• To be able to create, run, animate, and examine the results
of an Arena model of a simple DEDS

Drive Through Pharmacy
• Customers arrive at a drive through pharmacy window
according to a Poisson distribution with a mean of 10 per hour.
• The time that it takes the pharmacist to serve the customer is
random and data has indicated that the time is well modeled
with an exponential distribution with a mean of 3 minutes.
• Customers who arrive to the pharmacy are served in the order
of arrival and we assume that enough space is available within
the parking area of the adjacent grocery store to accommodate
any waiting customers
