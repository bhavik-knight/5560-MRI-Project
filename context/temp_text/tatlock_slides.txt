Conclusion

Introduction [2]
● First 2-bay MRI suite in Nova Scotia (1.5 T and 3 T
magnets)

An MRI technologist prepares a patient in the prep room at the QEII Health
Sciences Centre in Halifax. (Nova Scotia Health)

●

This site layout requires more planning and
administration from the techs

●

The wait time for an MRI is almost 2 years

●

The MRI scanner sits idle 31% of the time

●

If we take the steps to decrease the idle time, we
can solve the wait time issue for MRI scans in
Halifax

QEII MRI Wait times [3]
90% served within: 717 days (2+ years)
Bones and Joints: 554 days
Brain: 800 days
Chest and Abdomen: 744 days
Heart: 736 days

50% served within: 73 days (2+ months)
Bones and Joints: 195 days
Brain: 71 days
Chest and Abdomen: 40 days
Heart: 51 days

National Maximum Wait Time
Access Targets for MRI [1,4]
The Canadian Association of Radiologists determines:
Priority 1 (P1) Emergent cases - Life or limb
immediately threatened
● Same day- max 24 hours (some less than an
hour based on clinical team decisions)
Priority 2 (P2) Urgent- Life or limb not immediately
threatened. .
● Max of 7 days or ASAP
Priority 3 (P3) Semi-urgent- Imaging necessary
before P4 benchmark.
● Max 30 days
Priority 4 (P4) Non-urgent- no negative long-term
medical outcome related to delay in treatment if
● Max 60 days

3T Magnet Idle Time
During the hours of
operation the 3T magnet
sat idle for 78/247 hours
hours creating an idle
percentage of 31%
● this percentage
excludes a 5 minute idle
gap between cases!
● 42% idle with no alloted
gap (103/247 hours)

Background [2,5]

●

4 safety zones monitored by staff due
to safety concerns

●

●
●

Zone 1: freely accessible to the public
Zone 2: Patient supervised preparation
Zone 3: The tech control zone where
unscreened personnel or ferromagnetic
items become dangerous
Zone 4: The MRI scan room which is
clearly marked and strictly supervised

6 staff model
○ 4 technologists
○ 1 TA
○ 1 dedicated porter
2 Magnets = double the patient & staff
Organization and distinct roles are
required for efficiency

Project Overview

MRI 2-bay Workﬂow Project (Current Project):
● Simulate staff/patient tasks through the Siemens 2-bay MRI suite.
● Collect data to improve efficiency and workﬂow/ for future endeavours

Research Collaboration
Facility: Halifax Inﬁrmary MRI department
Dr. Chris Bowen: Lead MRI Researcher
Dr. Jennifer Payne: Lead Researcher/Dalhousie Professor
Dylan LeBlanc: MRI Technologist/Department Team Lead
SMU health research team: Research/IT
Kara Doucet: MRI Technologist
Grayson Porter: NSH Research Coordinator
HI MRI staff: Support
Jamie Eliasson: Dalhousie Professor/Radiological Technologist

Methodology
1. Deﬁning staff roles: 2 scan techs, 2 backup techs, an administration TA,
and the dedicated MRI porter.
2. Lay out all steps that each staff member and patients perform that tie
up resources and delay patient movement/create idle time. Also adding
in a backup staff member to cover breaks and low-probability events.
3. Create an effective workﬂow for efficient use of MRI zones and patient
movement.
4. Test out the workﬂow model and make adjustments based on staff
comments, patient comments, and data collection of the time it takes
for staff and patients to perform each step.

backup tech
Scan tech: follows patient through care to scanning
Back-up tech: assists with patient set up, ﬁnishes
paperwork, available for admin questions, priority
is to prep next patient
Communicate with the admin TA to transport
patients to and from the MRI department
Stocking, cleaning, and initial patient instructions

1 administrative TA

Manages clinical calendar, inpatient appointments,
outpatient ﬂuctuations, and facility calls

operation time)
Time for patient to be
prepared for theirs
scan without IV:
11m 37s

Discussion: What I learned
Things I learned about MRI workﬂow:
● 3 patients max in Zone 2
○ 2 patients being prepped and 1 exiting the magnet
○ With 2 change rooms, 2 bathrooms, many lockers, and 2 prep rooms
the patients are not waiting for these resources and are able to be
prepped for the scan before it is ready for them.
● Use Zone 1 to your advantage!
○ Patients do not need to be supervised and they can take their time
ﬁlling out the screening form instead of taking up resources in the
department
● The prep room is the ideal place for patients to wait
○ The patient is screened and has their IV inserted to ensure they are
fully prepared for their scan or ready to switch magnets if needed.

Conclusion [2]
● Consistency in data
● Type of exam changes workﬂow
● Communication
● Late/no-show effects
