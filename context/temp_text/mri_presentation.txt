Improving MRI Department Efficiency
Problem:

The MRI scanner sits idle 31% of the time during hours of operation (42% idle with no allotted 5minute gap)

Goal:

If we take the steps to decrease the idle time, we can solve the wait time issue for MRI scans in
Halifax

Modeling / Optimization Steps:
•

Step 1: Defining Staff Roles
o

Establish clear responsibilities for the 6-staff model

o 2 scan techs, 2 backup techs, an administration TA, and the dedicated MRI porter.

•

•

Step 2: Identify Idle Time Drivers
o

Lay out all steps that each staff member and patient perform

o

Tie up resources and delay patient movement/create idle time.

o

Include a backup staff member to cover breaks and low-probability events.

Step 3: Workflow Creation
o Create an effective workflow
o

•

MRI safety zones and patient movement.

Step 4: Testing and Adjustment
o Test out the workflow model and make adjustments based on staff comments, patient comments
o Time it takes for staff and patients to perform each step

Current System Modelling
• Arena Simulator:

Modelling Results (Stats)
• Arena Simulator:

I guess the utilization of MRI machine is around 30%

Optimization Techniques
• Spatial and Flow Optimization (Zones)
• Structural Optimization (Roles)

Spatial and Flow Optimization (Zones)
• Use Zone 1 to your advantage o Patients can take their time filling out the screening form here, as they do not need to be supervised.
o This prevents them from taking up resources in the main department.

• Utilize the Prep Room (Zone 2) as the Ideal Wait Area o The patient is screened here to ensure they are fully prepared for their scan or ready to switch magnets if needed.

o Limit Patients in Zone 2
o Maintain a maximum of 3 patients in Zone 2: 2 patients being prepped and 1 exiting the magnet, to manage flow without

creating bottlenecks.

• Focus on High-Time Tasks:
o Time for patient preparation ~ 16 mins,

o Time to complete scan ~ 30 mins.

Structural Optimization (Roles)
•

Scan Tech
o

•

•

•

•

Follows the current patient through their care until scanning is complete.

Backup Tech
o

Priority is to prep the next patient.

o

Assists with patient set up, finishes paperwork [~ is available for administration questions?]

Administrative TA
o

Manages the clinical calendar, handles inpatient appointments, outpatient fluctuations

o

Facility calls, freeing up technologists for clinical tasks.

Dedicated Porter
o

Communicates with the administrative TA to transport patients to and from the MRI department.

o

Handles stocking, cleaning, and initial patient instructions (should be allocated some more TA tasks post scan)

Staffing Model:
o

Ensure patients are not waiting for resources [change rooms, bathrooms, lockers, and prep rooms]

o

Prepped for the scan before it is ready for them.

Key Takeaways for Efficiency
• Spatial (Zone) optimization and Structural Optimization
• Especially in a 2-bay suite which handles double the patients and staff
• Operational Success Factors
o Consistency in data collection is vital for successful workflow improvement

• Workflow improvements must account for the fact that the type of exam changes the workflow
•

MRI Staff Scheduling Optimization and MRI Patient Scheduling Optimization

Alternative Technology to run Simulation
• SimPy – For Simulation
o Environment
o Entity - Events - States
o Processes (wait, interrupt)
o Resources (allocation, release) – Resources Container

• Streamlit – For FE/Visualization and Deploy
• Statistics Collection – Warm Up Period (To avoid Bias)
o KPIs – Cycle time, Wait time, Throughput Rate
o Mean, SD for various Simulation
