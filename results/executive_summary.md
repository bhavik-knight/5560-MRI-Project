# MRI Efficiency Simulation - Executive Summary

## 1. The Utilization Paradox (The "Bowen Metric")
**Source 56 / Source 104**
The simulation reveals a critical distinction between "Occupied Time" and "Productive Time". Traditional metrics often conflate these, hiding operational inefficiencies.

*   **Occupied Utilization**: 82.5% (The number reporting to finance)
*   **Productive Utilization**: 62.3% (The actual value delivered)
*   **Operational Overhead ("Yellow Time")**: 20.2%

**The Bowen Efficiency Ratio is 75.5%.**
This indicates that for every hour the magnet is "busy", only ~75 minutes are spent acquiring clinical images. The remaining Time is lost to setup, changeover, and 'Hot Seat' handovers.

## 2. Value Stream Validation (The "Tatlock Baseline")
**Source 9**
Our Zone 2 (Prep/Induction) simulation data was calibrated against the Tatlock empirical studies.

*   **Simulated Prep Cycle**: 8.7 mins
*   **Target Baseline**: 14.5 mins
*   **Variance**: -5.8 mins

A positive variance indicates that finding a vein or managing an anxious patient (The stochastic factors modeled in `backup.py`) is creating upstream bottlenecks that may starve the magnet.

## 3. Operational Variability (The "Long Tail")
**Source 155 / Source 26**
The core driver of waitlists is not the average scan time, but the variance.
*   **Standard Deviation of Scan Time**: 15.3 mins
*   **Coefficient of Variation**: 0.41

High variability makes static scheduling impossible without gaps. The "Long Tail" of complex cases (Cardiac/Abdomen) consistently disrupts the schedule.

## 4. Recommendations
**Source 133: The "Singles Line" Strategy**
Given the detected Operational Overhead of 20.2%, we recommend implementing a dynamic "Singles Line" strategy.
*   **Triggers:** If Gap > 5 mins is detected (Simulated avg gap: 251.8 mins total/shift).
*   **Action:** Pull from a 'Ready State' queue (Zone 2) to fill short-notice gaps.
*   **Impact:** Converting just half of the "Yellow Time" to "Green Time" would increase capacity by 10.1% without adding new hardware.
